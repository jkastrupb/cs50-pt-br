DAVID J. MALAN: É provável que você use um computador todos os dias

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,010
Mas o que está  acontecendo dentro deste laptop ou deste desktop?

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,676
Bem, dentro de um computador estão todos esses 0s e 1s.

6
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:19,800
E você pode ter ouvido falar mesmo que computadores só 

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,280
entendem 0s e 1s, ou seja, o sistema binário.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,620
Mas, se computadores hoje podem fazer tanta coisa, como eles  if computers today
can do so much, how can

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,920
fazem tudo isso se eles só sabem "falar" 0s e 1s e não 

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,230
todo o alfabeto inteiro que nós humanos temos.

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, consider this.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,130
Back in our human world, you might
recognize a pattern of symbols

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,590
like this as the number 123.

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,460
But why is that?

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,670
After all, all I did was draw
three shapes, really, three glyphs,

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,160
or three symbols or
digits on the screen.

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,130
But each of these digits
has some predefined meaning.

18
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,850
If, in fact, if you went to grade school
like I did and you learned numbers

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,610
in this way, odds are, you might
recall, that this rightmost

20
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,940
column is the so-called
one's column or one's place.

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,590
Then this is the ten's place.

22
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,510
And then this is the hundred's place.

23
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,349
Now why is that significant?

24
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:09,060
Well, the reason that 1, 2,
3-- that pattern represents

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,970
the number we humans know
is 123 is that there's

26
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,830
a bit of arithmetic going on here.

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,770
This, after all, means that you
should do 100 times 1 plus 10 times

28
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,280
2 plus 1 times 3.

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,930
That, of course, gives us
100 plus 20 plus 3 or 123.

30
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,540
In other words, there's a
pattern to these digits,

31
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,000
and there's a meaning
behind each of their places.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,930
Well, it turns out that computers
only, indeed, understand 0s and 1s.

33
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,920
They can't count as high as 2 and 3
and 4 in the same way we humans can.

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,080
But they use those 0s and
1s in exactly the same way.

35
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,640
In fact, consider this.

36
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,292
If we consider this pattern 0,
0, 0, to be inside of a computer,

37
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:56,250
and that's what the
computer is thinking, well,

38
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,610
what number might this be.

39
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,360
Well, the spoiler is
that this is actually

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,760
going to represent just 0, thankfully,
just like in our human world.

41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,910
But why is that the case?

42
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,030
And how can we count higher than 0?

43
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,030
Well, in the computer world,
realize that these places are just

44
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,870
a little different.

45
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,869
This is still the one's
place, but this next one

46
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:13,440
is not the ten's place anymore.

47
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,239
It's, instead, the two's place.

48
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,530
And this next place is not
the hundred's place anymore.

49
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,412
It's, instead, the four's place.

50
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:22,620
And if you think about this,
there's still a pattern.

51
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,370
Previously, it was 1, 10, 100,
and then if we kept going,

52
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,855
1,000, 10,000 100,000, and so forth.

53
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:31,230
And here, too, there's a pattern.

54
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,210
1, 2, 4-- and if I kept going--

55
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,540
8, 16, and 32.

56
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,930
And so, in our human world,
we tend to use powers of 10.

57
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,810
10 to 0 is 1, 10 to the 1
is 10, 10 to the 2 is 100.

58
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,510
And in the computer world, this
is 2 to the 0, which is 1, 2 to 1,

59
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,780
which is 2, 2 to the 2,
or 2 squared, which is 4.

60
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,820
2 to 3 would be 8 and so forth.

61
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,050
So all we're doing is changing the
base that we're using, so to speak.

62
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,930
Instead of powers of 10,
we're using powers of 2.

63
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,460
And so why is this number 0, 0, 0 the
number we humans know as 0 itself?

64
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:15,870
Well, again, if we just do the math, 4
times 0 plus 2 times 0 plus 1 times 0

65
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:22,050
is, of course, 0 plus 0 plus 0 or
the number we humans know as just 0.

66
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,420
Well, what if we do
another number altogether?

67
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,817
Suppose we do this pattern 0, 0, 1.

68
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:29,400
Well, what number does this represent?

69
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,120
Well, if you consider the same columns--

70
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,030
1, 2, and 4--

71
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,490
this means we have four times 0, which
is 0, 2 times 0, which is 0, 1 times

72
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,180
1, which is 1.

73
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,880
So this is the number
we humans know as 1.

74
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,380
All right.

75
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,280
So not all that interesting yet,
but what about the number 2?

76
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,190
How, in binary, bi meaning two, and the
2 being a 0 and a 1, how, in binary,

77
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,480
can I now count as high as 2?

78
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,260
Well, if this is my one's
place, this is my two's place,

79
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,060
and this is my four's place, what digits
do I want to put below those places

80
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,840
if the only digits I have at my
disposal now are not 0 through 9,

81
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,940
but just 0 through 1?

82
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,841
Well, I don't need a 4,
so I can make that a 0.

83
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:15,340
I do need 2 if I want to count
to the number we know as two,

84
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,589
so I'm going to put a 1 there.

85
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,389
And I don't need an extra 1
because an extra 1 would give me 3.

86
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,810
So I'm going to do this.

87
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,650
And so a computer, to
store the number we humans

88
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,540
know as two in decimal which
store it in binary as 0, 1, 0.

89
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,800
Because that's 4 times 0 plus
2 times 1 plus time 1 times 0,

90
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,380
which, of course, is going
to give me the number 2.

91
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,195
What about 3?

92
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:38,050
Well, in the world of
computers, if we again

93
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,210
have our one's place two's
place and four's place,

94
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,966
how do I now arrange my zeros and ones
to give me the number we know as 3?

95
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:45,340
Well, let's see I don't need a 4.

96
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,256
That would be too big.

97
00:04:46,256 --> 00:04:48,340
I do need a 2, and I do need a 1.

98
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,900
And that is now going to give me 3.

99
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:56,110
Because 2 times 1, 1 times 1 is
2, 1 times 1 is 1, 2 plus 1 is 3.

100
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,399
Now what about 4?

101
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,690
How do I count as high as four?

102
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,630
Well, it's even easier, perhaps because
we just need a single 1 in this case.

103
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,016
We just need 1, 0, 0.

104
00:05:05,016 --> 00:05:06,890
Because now I have one
1 in the four's place.

105
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,960
And now let's skip ahead.

106
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,450
Suppose I want to count up
as high as, let's say, 7?

107
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,780
What do I do?

108
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,280
Well, 7, let me take a byte out of that.

109
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,490
So this gives me 4.

110
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,040
Let me take a two, that
gives me 4 plus 2, that's 6.

111
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,930
Let me give myself another 1.

112
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,160
1, 1, 1, in binary, equals 7.

113
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,990
Now what about a number like 8?

114
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,810
I can't seem to count as high as 8
unless I give myself another bit.

115
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,190
But that's OK because,
just as in the human world,

116
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,773
if you have not a three-digit
number, but a four-digit number,

117
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,000
you simply add another place.

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,456
So it might be the ones column, the
tens, the hundreds, the thousands.

119
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:46,330
In this case, though, it's going to
be the ones, the twos, the fours,

120
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,020
and the eights.

121
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,150
And so if we want to count
as high as 8 in binary,

122
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,160
we might do 1, 0, 0, 0, which,
of course, gives me 8 times 1.

123
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,750
And then everything else is 0.

124
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,220
So that gives me the number 8.

125
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,780
So even though computers
only speak 0s and 1s

126
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,880
and only understand the
so-called binary system,

127
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,760
they can still count as
high as we humans can.

128
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,630
And they fundamentally do
it, really, in the same way.

129
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,510
It's just that they have
a smaller vocabulary.

130
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,600
But why do they have
a smaller vocabulary,

131
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,100
especially when they can do so much?

132
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,450
Well, it turns out that,
in the physical world,

133
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,701
it's just convenient to be able to
represent only two states instead

134
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:23,200
of 10.

135
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,630
And by states, I mean
digits, in this case.

136
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,670
It's a lot easier in
the human world, not

137
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,450
to represent 10 possible
values 0 or 9, but just two--

138
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,375
0 and 1.

139
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,750
And we could have called those
digits anything we wanted,

140
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,999
but we humans just standardized
our numbers like that.

141
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:43,420
But 0 and 1 is nice because if you think
of one of these binary digits or bits

142
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,390
as just being a light bulb--
it's either off or on.

143
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,380
You can think of a 0 as
a light bulb being off

144
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,270
and a one as being a
light bulb being on.

145
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,750
And light bulbs, of course, in our human
world just need electricity to run.

146
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,320
And so, if we somehow get electricity
into our computer laptop, desktop,

147
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,500
or whatnot coming from the power
outlet in the wall or some battery,

148
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,310
well, that would seem to be
sufficient input in order

149
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:11,260
to turn a light bulb on or off, to
turn a switch, really, on or off.

150
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,770
And indeed, that's what's inside
of our computers-- transistors,

151
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,060
otherwise known as switches.

152
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,270
And these transistors, which now
number in the billions in the most

153
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,720
modern of computers are tiny,
tiny, tiny little light switches,

154
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,810
if you will, that, if turned on,
allow us to store 1s, if turned off,

155
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,030
allow us to store 0s.

156
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,760
And using those many,
many, many transistors,

157
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,270
can we store values, can we
store data, can we compute,

158
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,380
and can we actually do everything we
can today with our modern computers.

159
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,970
Let's make this more real and
try out some actual light bulbs.

160
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,880
So here are some light bulbs
clamped into these desk lamps.

161
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,520
And suppose now that I
have these light bulbs here

162
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,530
to represent bits or binary digits.

163
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,710
So each of these light bulbs
can represent a 0 if it's off

164
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,310
or a 1 if it's on.

165
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,880
And if we think about the same
system that computers use,

166
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,330
let's think of this bulb here as
being the one's place, this bulb here

167
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,260
as being the two's place and this
bulb here as being the four's place.

168
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,300
So what number am I
currently representing

169
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,520
if all of these light bulbs are off?

170
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,575
Well, that's like having 0, 0, 0.

171
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:17,950
Since they're all off, so that's the
number we humans know in decimal,

172
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,440
dec meaning 10, as 0.

173
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,539
What about if I turn on just
this one light bulb here?

174
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:24,580
What does that represent?

175
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,930
This, again, is the one's place, the
two's place, and the four's place.

176
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,820
So this, of course, represents
the number we know as 1.

177
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,720
Now, if I go ahead and
simultaneously switch these,

178
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,799
this is still the one's place, the
two's place, and the four's place.

179
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,634
So what is this?

180
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,960
This, now, is the number we know as 2.

181
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,610
How do I count as high as 3?

182
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,470
I don't want to keep
going down the line.

183
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,960
Instead, I want to turn this 1 back on
because that means I get a 1 plus a 2.

184
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,180
I don't need the 4, which is
great, because now I have 3.

185
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,350
How do I get to 4 then?

186
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,250
Well, let me turn both of these off,
turn this one on, and now, of course,

187
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,420
this is the four's place.

188
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,620
So this is a 4.

189
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,250
If I turn this one back on, now we're
up to a four's place and a one's place,

190
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,630
so that gives me 5.

191
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:12,420
If I turn this off, this on, that
gives me a 4 plus a 2, or a 6.

192
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,260
And finally, if that
turns on, I have now a 7.

193
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,540
Unfortunately, I can't
count as high as 8

194
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,790
unless I go get myself
another desk lamp,

195
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,416
but for that we just need another bit.

196
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:27,330
But this is all very fine and good, but
all I can represent thus far, it seems,

197
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,010
are numbers.

198
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,240
How, though, do I represent letters
of the actual alphabet, A through Z?

199
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,820
How do I represent
words or paragraphs, let

200
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,529
alone emails, and any number of other
features that computers today support?

201
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:41,820
Well, for that, we're going
to need to make a decision.

202
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,250
We're going to need to
decide what patterns of bits

203
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,990
to use to represent those higher
level notions like letters

204
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,610
words and paragraphs.

205
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,050
So for that, I've got an idea.

206
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,650


207
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,972
So at the end of the day, all computers
can store is, indeed, 0s and 1s.

208
00:09:59,972 --> 00:10:01,680
And from those zeros
and ones, of course,

209
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,950
can we count higher so long as we have
a mapping from binary to the numbers

210
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,900
we know as decimal.

211
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,990
But, of course, we want
our computers to do more.

212
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,656
We want to be able to express
words and even other types of data.

213
00:10:12,656 --> 00:10:13,530
So how do we do that?

214
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,950
Well, we need to come up with
a standardization, a mapping,

215
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,610
from 0s and 1s, or really just
numbers, to the letters that we want.

216
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,394
And it turns out, that some years ago
what humans decided to do was this.

217
00:10:24,394 --> 00:10:26,810
Now, at first glance, this
might be a little overwhelming.

218
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,505
This is just a screenshot of
a chart from asciichart.com.

219
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:34,260
An ASCII chart is a chart of ASCII
characters, American Standard

220
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,270
Code for Information Interchange.

221
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:40,410
And this is simply a mapping
from decimal numbers to letters.

222
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,150
And so on let's notice a few of these.

223
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:48,690
Notice here that 65 apparently maps
to A, 66 maps to B, 67 maps to C,

224
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,410
and so forth.

225
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:55,320
Meanwhile, 97 maps to lowercase a,
98 to lowercase b, 99 to lowercase c,

226
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,140
and so forth.

227
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,590
And there's also mappings
from punctuation symbols

228
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,160
to all the letters of the
alphabet that you may know.

229
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,180
So why is this significant?

230
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,180
Well, it turns out that even though
computers only store 0s and 1s,

231
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,930
we, of course, use
them in different ways.

232
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,860
We have programs like Notepad
on PCs, or TextEdit on Mac OS,

233
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,640
or Microsoft Word on both platforms,
or Google spreadsheets, or Google Docs,

234
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,370
or the like.

235
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,161
And so we have all
these different programs

236
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:22,960
that is designed to do
one thing or the other.

237
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,060
And so those programs essentially
decide, in their own context,

238
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,380
whether to display patterns of
bits as numbers or as letters

239
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,120
or, in turn, words and paragraphs.

240
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,580
So it's entirely context-dependent.

241
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,610
At the end of the day, all the
computer is storing is 0s and 1s,

242
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,240
but it's up to the program to interpret
those 0s and 1s in a certain way.

243
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,650
And so, if a program like
Microsoft Word or Google Docs

244
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:54,580
sees a pattern of bits in a file that
represents the decimal number 65--

245
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,919
it's still pattern of 0s
and 1s expressed in binary,

246
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,460
but of course, we've seen how
we can convert that to decimal.

247
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,300
So if a computer is ultimately
storing a pattern of 0s and 1s

248
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,900
that represents the decimal
number 65, the computer,

249
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,130
in this case Microsoft Word, or Google
Docs, and the program running there,

250
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,650
is going to interpret that
pattern, not as the number 65,

251
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:18,240
and not as a whole bunch of 0s and 1s
alone, but as the capital letter A.

252
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,990
And that's what you'll
see on your screen.

253
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,022
If it, instead, sees a pattern of bits
that represents the decimal number 66,

254
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:25,980
Microsoft Word or Google
Docs is going to show,

255
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,530
instead, the capitol letter
B. If the pattern of bits

256
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,680
instead represents
the decimal number 97,

257
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,490
that program is going to display
the lowercase letter a or any number

258
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,630
of other letters from the alphabet.

259
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,730
And so we just had to decide
in advance what mapping to use,

260
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,850
what code to use that
maps numbers to letters.

261
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,370
And in fact, you'll notice
that quite a few characters

262
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,890
are absent from the screen here.

263
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,140
In fact, if you speak some language and
write some language other than English

264
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,931
there might be some
characters that you can

265
00:12:53,931 --> 00:12:56,890
express with just this range of values.

266
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,300
In fact ASCII originally
only used 7 bits total.

267
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,350
Or if you round up, 8 bits total,
for what's called the extended ASCII.

268
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:09,930
And it turns out, that's not nearly
enough patterns of bits, 256 maximally,

269
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,240
that you can use to express
characters that you might

270
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,900
see in certain Asian languages or
symbols that just simply are not

271
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,880
depicted even yet on the screen here.

272
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,770
So there are other
systems, not just ASCII.

273
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,400
Something called Unicode, for instance,
is a superset of what you see here.

274
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,190
And that actually allows us to
express any number of characters

275
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,550
from English and Asian languages
and beyond and, in fact, even

276
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,739
things like the emoji
characters-- the smiley faces,

277
00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:35,280
and other such characters that
you might now use increasingly

278
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,170
on your phone, your desktop, or laptop.

279
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:40,287
Those two are expressed ultimately
as just patterns of bits.

280
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,120
And the world, for the
most part, has simply

281
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,820
standardized on what
pattern of bits represents

282
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,450
a happy face, what pattern of
bits represents a sad face,

283
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,750
and beyond, in that
system there is Unicode.

284
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,740
So let's take an example.

285
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,450
Suppose that you see this pattern
of bits somewhere in a file.

286
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,840
And you, in this context, say are
Microsoft Word, or Google Docs,

287
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,560
or some program designed to display,
not numbers like a calculator,

288
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,310
but words and letters like a
word processor or a text editor.

289
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,140
Well, what is this pattern of bits?

290
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,000
Well, we haven't seen
this many bits before,

291
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,230
but it looks to be like
two patterns of eight.

292
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,580
And in fact, it turns out that anytime
you have eight bits here or eight bits

293
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:24,810
here, humans generally refer
to this as a byte, B-Y-T-E.

294
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,730
So a byte is just eight bits.

295
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,920
And it's a slightly more
useful measure because it's

296
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,980
a lot bigger than a single bit, which
can, of course, only represent 0 or 1.

297
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,260
A byte can actually count higher.

298
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,640
So what are the columns here if we
look only at this number at left?

299
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:48,370
This is my 1's place, 2's, 4's, 8's,
16's, 32's, and 64, and then 128.

300
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,030
So in which of these columns
do I actually have values?

301
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,770
I seem to have a 1 in the 64's place.

302
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,030
And I seem to have a
1 in the 16's place.

303
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:04,520
So 64 plus 16, if I do that
arithmetic, that gives me 72.

304
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,070
So this pattern of
bits on the left here,

305
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,250
seems to be representing the number 72.

306
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,860
Now let's consider the
pattern of bits on the right.

307
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:21,950
Again, my 1's place, 2's place,
4's 8's, 16's, 32, 64, 128.

308
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,070
Now notice, these patterns
are actually almost identical.

309
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,040
We've got a 1 in the 64's place,
we've got a 1 in the 16's place,

310
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,390
but we've also got an
extra one in the 1's place.

311
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:38,450
So if this was 72, and this pattern
is identical except for this last bit

312
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:44,542
here, which adds 1, this
must be 72 followed by 73.

313
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:46,250
And I've put a space
here, visually, just

314
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,916
to separate the fact that these
are, indeed, two separate bytes.

315
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,250
And I claim now that, yes,
while you could interpret these

316
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:59,210
as two decimal digits, 72 and 73,
it turns out, per the ASCII system,

317
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:03,590
we could map 72 and 73
to alphabetical letters.

318
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,850
What might those letters be?

319
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,480
Well, if we consider our
chart again, 72 apparently

320
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,990
gives us a capital H. 73
gives us the capital I.

321
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:16,400
And, voila, 72 followed by 73 in
a computer's memory, apparently,

322
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,400
is how a computer would express HI.

323
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,750
And of course, if we used more bytes,
and therefore more bits, and therefore

324
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,250
more numbers, we could represent even
larger words than just H I, or HI.

325
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,410
But that's exactly how a computer,
underneath the hood so to speak,

326
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,400
would store a word like HI.

327
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,700
Now what is indeed using
these patterns of bits?

328
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,940
And what is a computer actually
doing at the end of the day?

329
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,900
Well, for that, we need to take a
look under the hood, so to speak.

330
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,170
This is what Intel inside means.

331
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:54,380
If your Mac or your PC
comes with an Intel Inside,

332
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,060
as goes the marketing slogan, that means
that your computer has inside of it

333
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,916
a CPU, a Central Processing Unit that
looks a little something like this.

334
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,040
It's a pretty small device.

335
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,405
It's not quite as big as this.

336
00:17:05,405 --> 00:17:06,858
This, of course, is not to scale.

337
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:09,318
It wouldn't fit in your
actual laptop or desktop.

338
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,700
But what you see is two sides.

339
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,144
This is just a mental case
and a nice big logo there.

340
00:17:13,144 --> 00:17:15,560
And then, if you flip this
around, you see the other side,

341
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,440
which generally has a
whole bunch of golden pins

342
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,579
that actually interconnect to a
device inside of the computer.

343
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,710
And now what is that device?

344
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,118
Well, that device, we'll soon see,
is something called the motherboard.

345
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:31,190
A motherboard is a circuit
board, so a big piece

346
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,610
of silicon or plastic-like
material that has

347
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,340
a lot of lines running
back and forth on it,

348
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,580
and often has sockets, essentially,
a bunch of tiny little holes

349
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,590
into which devices like this fit so that
you can put this inside of a computer

350
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,810
and actually have it
clamped down on something.

351
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,670
Now what does it mean to be a CPU?

352
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,546
Well, the CPU is the
brains of your computer.

353
00:17:51,546 --> 00:17:53,253
It's the thing in your
computer that does

354
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:54,800
all of the work, all of the thinking.

355
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,930
Now what kind of thinking
does a computer need to do?

356
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,550
Well, if you're feeding
it all of these numbers,

357
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,410
and you're feeding it
all of these letters,

358
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,200
you want to maybe perform
math on those numbers.

359
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,796
You might want to display
those letters on the screen.

360
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:07,670
You might want to add
or delete those letters

361
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,340
if the user is using a word
processor and typing new characters

362
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,270
or hitting delete.

363
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,020
And so a computer needs to do all of
that thinking and work for the human.

364
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,440
And the peace inside of the
computer that does most of that work

365
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,220
is, indeed, this device
here called the CPU.

366
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,720
Now, it turns out, that CPUs today
are actually getting pretty fancy.

367
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,690
And inside of a CPU, typically,
is one or more cores, so to speak.

368
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,340
And a core is really
what's doing the work.

369
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,790
And it is the device inside
of this device that actually

370
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,760
can do addition, and subtraction,
and multiplication, and division,

371
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,730
and other operations still
loading information from memory,

372
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,470
saving information to memory.

373
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:50,270
And so a CPU like this might have
one, or two, or four or more cores,

374
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:54,810
which means it can do one, or two,
or four or more things at a time.

375
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,260
And that's great because,
these days on my Mac or my PC,

376
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,120
I might double-click a
whole bunch of icons.

377
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,680
I might be running multiple programs.

378
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,420
I might be chatting
with a friend over here.

379
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,253
I might be working on
my homework over here.

380
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:07,640
And so I might have a lot of programs
and a lot of files open simultaneously.

381
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,350
And thanks to multiple cores inside
of a CPU, can each of those programs

382
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,264
continue running in parallel.

383
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:16,180
Maybe one is printing
something to my printer.

384
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,080
Or maybe one is playing back a video.

385
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,790
Maybe one is spell-checking a file.

386
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,180
Any number of operations can
literally be happening simultaneously.

387
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,320
Now moreover, it turns out
that the fanciest of use today,

388
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,950
from Intel especially, also support
something called hyperthreading,

389
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,740
which means you might just
have one CPU or one core,

390
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,970
but thanks to some technology
built into the CPU itself,

391
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,660
it will present itself to the
computer, to the operating system,

392
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,600
Mac OS or Windows--
more on those in a bit--

393
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,900
as though it's actually
two CPUs or two cores.

394
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,800
And so, thanks to technology,
can your computer actually

395
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,990
think it has even more computational
power than it actually has,

396
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,870
thereby allowing it to
take advantage of downtime

397
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,200
or slow running programs
that might still allow you

398
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,990
to run multiple things simultaneously.

399
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,390
But we'll come back
to that in just a bit.

400
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,710
Now, not all devices have just a
CPU connected to a motherboard.

401
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:17,010
Some devices, instead, have a CPU and
more all interconnected all at once.

402
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,530
And these things are generally
known as systems on a chip.

403
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:23,490
And they're especially popular in
things like tablets or iPads these days,

404
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,420
game consoles like Xboxes or even
things like the Raspberry Pi,

405
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,870
which is a very small computer
that looks pretty much like this.

406
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,780
Also not to scale, this thing
could fit in the palm of my hand.

407
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,230
And this has, not only one of
these silicon circuit boards--

408
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:41,220
generally green, and you'll see
there's very fine lines or traces that

409
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,380
interconnect all of the
chips and technology

410
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,570
that's plugged into this
thing-- and it also has,

411
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,050
well, first and foremost, no case.

412
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,924
There's no pretty plastic case that
protects all of these components.

413
00:20:49,924 --> 00:20:51,690
It really is just a
raw piece of hardware

414
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:56,370
that computer technophiles like
to use to build their own machines

415
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,230
and programs.

416
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,970
But it has a whole bunch of ports--

417
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,190
as we'll return to in a
bit-- a whole bunch of places

418
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,450
you can connect other devices.

419
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,480
But these systems on a
chip all come together.

420
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,890
And they do many things beyond
just the CPU's task alone.

421
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,690
But what else is inside
of your computer?

422
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,400
Well, the CPU is the brain.

423
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,070
And the CPU on a system on
a chip is thereto the brain.

424
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,909
But there's other components
necessary inside of a computer

425
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:21,950
so we can do actual work.

426
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,890
And one of those things is called
memory or random access memory.

427
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:29,835
And random access memory
looks, physically, like this.

428
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:35,850
This is a chip that you might slide into
a little slot inside of your computer

429
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:39,750
specifically on the so-called
motherboard, again, a big greenish

430
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,479
board into which all of your
computer's components connect.

431
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:45,270
And there's usually a little divot
here, a little bump to make sure

432
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,311
you put it in the right way-- instead
this way, instead of, for instance,

433
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:48,960
that way.

434
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,140
And then on this green circuit
board are all these various chips

435
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,210
that actually store your data.

436
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:59,400
Specifically, they store your data in
a volatile way, only when the power is

437
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,890
on, when your laptop has
battery and is running

438
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,440
or when your laptop is
plugged in and is running.

439
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,960
Which is to say, when you
double-click an icon on the screen

440
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,920
or run some program, open
some file, those files

441
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,750
are loaded into the little black
chips that you see on this stick here.

442
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,450
They're loaded into RAM
or Random Access Memory.

443
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,070
And this memory is pretty fast.

444
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,620
And it is where those
files and programs live,

445
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,950
so long as you are using them
at a given moment in time.

446
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,070
Now other devices have slightly
different looking sticks of RAM.

447
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,200
This is a smaller stick
here that's actually

448
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,250
found, typically, in laptops or certain
desktop models, but it's the same idea.

449
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,210
It's simply a different form factor.

450
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,720
Now you can actually
see in your Mac or PC

451
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,869
sometimes exactly how much
RAM you have, especially

452
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:44,160
if you bought the computer
without knowing this concept

453
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,630
or were given the computer
and didn't think to ask.

454
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:50,610
In fact, on Windows, if you open
up the so-called Task Manager

455
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,810
and look at the CPU tab, you might
see a little something like this.

456
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:58,080
You'll see one, a nice little chart
that shows you what your CPU has

457
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,820
been doing over the past few seconds.

458
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,650
And the higher these peaks
are, the busier it was.

459
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,733
Maybe you double-clicked
an icon or played a video

460
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:06,270
or sent a really big email
or something like that.

461
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,690
But more interesting, down
here, is the speed of your CPU.

462
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,300
This one is 1.9 for gigahertz.

463
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,500
And a gigahertz means 1
billion things per second.

464
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,060
So a you that's 1.9 for gigahertz
means that this computer, this CPU

465
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:25,290
can do 1.94 billion things per second--

466
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,030
additions, subtractions,
multiplications,

467
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,740
printing to the screen,
any number of other things.

468
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,200
But if we look, odds are this is
marketed, frankly, as 2 gigahertz,

469
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,720
and maybe it has burst technology
whereby it can actually

470
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,840
go even a little faster,
maximum speed 2.81

471
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,942
gigahertz by maybe using a little
more energy for some amount of time

472
00:23:44,942 --> 00:23:46,650
and therefore generating
a bit more heat.

473
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:50,430
But you'll see that there's only one
socket in the computer from which I

474
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,260
took this screenshot from Windows,
which means there's one CPU.

475
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:57,420
But that CPU has two cores, which means
that the computer can do literally

476
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,687
two things at once because it has
really two brains inside of that device

477
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:03,270
that we saw a picture of a moment ago.

478
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,580
But logically, it actually seems four.

479
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:10,860
So this particular windows computer
has a CPU with two cores, each of which

480
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,350
supports that technology
called hyperthreading, which

481
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:17,820
means that each of those cores will
present itself to the Windows operating

482
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,290
system as though it's two.

483
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,470
Which is to say each core will
do two things simultaneously,

484
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:26,820
thereby giving me four logical
processors or, really, the ability

485
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,110
to do 4 total things at once.

486
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,920
So perhaps lower level detail
than is perhaps germane,

487
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,250
but these are the kinds of things
that you end up paying for in a store

488
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,144
or when you buy a computer online.

489
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:39,810
This is what distinguishes a less
expensive computer from a more

490
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:44,100
expensive computer is just
how fast the CPU or CPUs are

491
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,160
and just how many cores
the CPU has and, therefore,

492
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,180
just how much work you can get
done at a given moment in time

493
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,630
or just how quickly you
can work more generally.

494
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,800
Now, in a Mac, if you open
up your System Profiler,

495
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,010
you'll see a different kind of
interface, but similar information.

496
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,260
This is taken here from a MacBook Pro.

497
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:07,450
You can see that this CPU
is 3.1 gigahertz, so faster,

498
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,710
but it has one processor,
total number of cores is two.

499
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,940
And so, here, we see no mention of
hyperthreading, which generally windows

500
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,260
is a bit more detailed on, but this does
mean that this CPU is pretty darn fast,

501
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,690
3.1 billion things per second.

502
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:27,670
And it actually has two cores, so it
can do at least two things at once.

503
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,270
All right.

504
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,870
So that's my CPU, which does all
the thinking and all of the work.

505
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:35,320
That's RAM or random access memory
where all of my data and programs

506
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,390
are stored while I am using them.

507
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,250
So what else do I need?

508
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,900
Well, where are those programs and
files stored when the power is not on

509
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,500
or when my battery is dead or when
my computer is not even plugged in.

510
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,270
Now, odds are, if your computer is like
mine, you don't lose all of your files

511
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,580
and all of your programs just
because your battery dies

512
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,205
or you move a computer, and
therefore, unplug it from the wall.

513
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:59,020
It would not be a very useful device.

514
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:03,550
Computers do have nonvolatile
memory that sticks around

515
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:06,610
even when the power is lost, but
it uses a different technology

516
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,050
than RAM for that.

517
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,860
It tends to use a disk or a
hard disk, as in this case.

518
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:16,240
So this is a device that a PC desktop
or Mac desktop might have inside of it.

519
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,050
And it actually stores quite a bit
more information than a stick of RAM.

520
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:25,060
A stick of RAM might store one gigabyte,
two gigabytes, maybe even 16 gigabytes.

521
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,510
But a hard drive, as
this thing is called,

522
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,640
will actually store 256 gigabytes,
or maybe 1,000 gigabytes,

523
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,440
AKA a terabyte or even two
terabytes or four terabytes, which

524
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,992
is an order of magnitude
more than our sticks of RAM.

525
00:26:41,992 --> 00:26:44,200
Inside of this device,
though, meanwhile is something

526
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,800
that feels kind of old school.

527
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,600
It's actually one or more
metal platters that literally

528
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,330
physically spin around mechanically.

529
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:55,310
And on those platters is
your data actually stored.

530
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:58,300
So in RAM, there were no moving parts.

531
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,450
There is no fan, there's no motor,
there's nothing to move back and forth.

532
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,770
It's entirely electronic.

533
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,050
It's all electrons at
the end of the day.

534
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,692
But a hard drive is a mechanical
device that actually has one or more

535
00:27:08,692 --> 00:27:10,900
of these platters spinning
and spinning and spinning.

536
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,775
And that's what allows
the computer to access

537
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:14,440
different areas of those platters.

538
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,350
And, in fact, you'll see one or
more of these little reading heads,

539
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,720
not unlike old school
phonograph or record

540
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,940
players that actually
move back and forth

541
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,760
and read the data from that device.

542
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,510
And what's nice about this
device is that it's nonvolatile.

543
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:34,510
It uses tiny, tiny magnetic particles,
little specks of magnetic particles,

544
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,240
that, if you orient them
this way might represent a 1.

545
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,120
If you orient them this way it might
represent a 0-- so north to south pole,

546
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,050
south to north pole if you
remember some of your electronics.

547
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:48,010
But all that is to say is there's tiny,
tiny, tiny little particles on here,

548
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:52,030
billions or more perhaps, that,
depending on their orientation up

549
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,690
or down, represent a 1 or 0.

550
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,440
And if you have enough
of those particles,

551
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,580
you can represent bytes or
megabytes or gigabytes or terabytes

552
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,740
or more or anything in between.

553
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,000
And so you have the ability
to store data this way

554
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,100
or this way, even when the power is off.

555
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,600
The power is used just to read the
data or to write or change the data.

556
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,470
It doesn't need to stick
around to persist the data.

557
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:20,110
So in fact, why don't we take
a look at what this motor looks

558
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,050
like when actually running.

559
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:26,590
This is a short video from the
Slow Mo Guys, which gives us

560
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,470
a sense of what the hard drive
looks like when its lid is indeed

561
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,490
removed like that there.

564
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:45,760
DAVID J. MALAN: Fascinating.

565
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,450
I know.

566
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:50,170
Well, now let's actually take the
hood off of an actual hard drive,

567
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:55,150
albeit via animation, and actually see
and hear what it is that's going on.

568
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,420
And in this depiction here, you'll see
that the magnetic particles ultimately

569
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,720
are represented as red-blue,
or blue-red particles, which

570
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,120
represent precisely those
magnetic particles that

571
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,110
represent your 0s and 1s.

572
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,460
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

573
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,660
- The hard drive is where your PC
stores most of its permanent data.

574
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,600
To do that, the data
travels from RAM along

575
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,040
with software signals that tell the
hard drive how to store that data.

576
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:24,000
The hard drive circuits translate those
signals into voltage fluctuations.

577
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,170
These, in turn, control the
hard drive's moving parts--

578
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,900
some of the few moving parts
left in the modern computer.

579
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,090
Some of the signals control a motor
which spins metal-coated platters.

580
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,400
Your data is actually
stored on these platters.

581
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:43,670
Other signals move the read-write heads
to read or write data on the platters.

582
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,540
This machinery is so precise
that a human hair couldn't even

583
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,290
pass between the heads
and spinning platters.

584
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,425
Yet, it all works at terrific speeds.

585
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:53,315
[END VIDEO]

586
00:29:53,315 --> 00:29:55,190
DAVID J. MALAN: So where
are those particles?

587
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:58,550
Well, for that, we're going to have to
zoom in even closer because they're not

588
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,050
visible to the human eye.

589
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,730
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

590
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,700
- Let's look at what we
just saw in slow motion.

591
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,210
When a brief pulse of electricity
is sent to the read-write head,

592
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,960
it flips on a tiny electromagnet
for a fraction of a second.

593
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,050
The magnet creates a field
which changes the polarity

594
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,540
of a tiny, tiny portion
of the metal particles

595
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,940
which coat each platter surface.

596
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,940
A pattern series of these tiny
charged up areas on the disk

597
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:27,560
represents a single bit of data in the
binary number system used by computers.

598
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,470
Now, if the current is sent one
way through the read-write head,

599
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,911
the area is polarized in one direction.

600
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:34,910
If the current is set in
the opposite direction,

601
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,010
the polarization is reversed.

602
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,440
How do you get data off the hard disk?

603
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,151
Just reverse the process.

604
00:30:41,151 --> 00:30:43,400
So it's the particles on the
disk that get the current

605
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,140
in the read-write head moving.

606
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,570
Put together millions of
these magnetized segments,

607
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,190
and you've got a file.

608
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,160
Now, the pieces of a single
file may be scattered

609
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,150
all over a drive's platters kind of
like the mess of papers on your desk.

610
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,560
So a special extra file keeps
track of where everything is.

611
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,490
Don't you wish you had
something like that?

612
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,899
[END VIDEO]

613
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:07,190
DAVID J. MALAN: Now, anytime
you have a physical device

614
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,980
like this that's spinning
all day long or for months

615
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,340
on end, if you use your computer a lot
and for quite a long period of time,

616
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,760
something could go wrong.

617
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,800
Maybe you accidentally bump the desktop
or the laptop, the result of which

618
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,590
is that this reading head might
actually strike the platter

619
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,680
and make a dent in it or some kind of
scratch which actually will corrupt,

620
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,970
not only some of the data
perhaps, but might even

621
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,950
stop the whole device from working if
the reading head no longer functions

622
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:31,620
properly.

623
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,980
Moreover, anything
that's physical like this

624
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,220
isn't going to spin all that
fast at the end of the day.

625
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,950
Now technically, a hard drive like
this might spin 7,200 times per minute

626
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:45,260
or even 10,000 times per minute,
but that's much, much slower

627
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,900
than the speed with
which electrons travel

628
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,057
as they would in something like RAM.

629
00:31:50,057 --> 00:31:51,890
Well, fortunately, it
turns out that there's

630
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,770
something in between those technologies
that doesn't have moving parts,

631
00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:00,440
but that's not quite as fast as
RAM, but that is non-volatile,

632
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,050
whereby it will store
your data persistently

633
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,520
even when the power is off.

634
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:09,980
And this is so-called flash memory or
a Solid State Disk, SSD, in this case

635
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,490
here.

636
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,360
It's a smaller device, whereas typical
hard drives that have moving parts

637
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,000
are very often 3 and 1/2
inches, although 2 and 1/2 inch

638
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,910
versions do exist as well, in diameter.

639
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:25,190
A solid state drive tends to
be only 2.5 inches in width

640
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,920
so that it actually fits inside
of computers in the same slots

641
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,280
that older more mechanical
hard drives might fit.

642
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,720
But it doesn't have moving parts.

643
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,844
In fact, if we open it up, you'll see
something very reminiscent of the RAM

644
00:32:35,844 --> 00:32:36,560
we saw earlier.

645
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:41,090
But the technology inside of this
device is such that the data persists,

646
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:44,420
even when your battery dies or
you unplug your laptop or desktop.

647
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:50,690
But the upside of an SSD, being entirely
electronic, is that it's much faster.

648
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,490
And so this means that
your programs will

649
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,950
load faster when you
double-click them, your files

650
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,110
will open up faster when
you double-click on them.

651
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:00,860
Anything you might do or save to
your hard drive or solid state drive,

652
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,620
in this case, will actually get
saved much more quickly, which

653
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,501
means you might see a little hourglass
or spinning beachball much less

654
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:08,000
frequently.

655
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,930
And your computer is going to
behave and certainly feel faster.

656
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:15,530
Now the catch is that solid
state drives, theoretically,

657
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:19,040
won't necessarily last as long,
depending on the quality of the brand

658
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,170
and the technology being
used whereby they only

659
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,730
have a finite number of writes.

660
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,770
You can read from them
nearly as much as you want.

661
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,300
But over time, they'll degrade
in terms of how many times

662
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,530
you can keep writing to them.

663
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,270
Now, for many people this
might be a non-issue,

664
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,390
but to mitigate against this, has
the industry also introduced what are

665
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,870
called hybrid drives--

666
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:40,550
hard drives that might be the
same size as this or the same size

667
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,520
as a 3 and 1/2 inch drive like
the spinning mechanical device we

668
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,240
saw a moment ago in our animated form--

669
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,030
but they might have both
some solid state memory

670
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:54,710
and some mechanical hard drive memory
so that you might have a few megabytes

671
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:57,170
or gigabytes of solid state memory.

672
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:00,920
And you might have a few gigabytes
or terabytes of traditional hard disk

673
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,610
space.

674
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:05,570
And the device itself moves
your data around in a clever way

675
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:08,060
so that it tries to keep as
much of the data that you

676
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,870
want to use, at a given moment, on
the solid state part of the device

677
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:14,000
so that it's readily accessible for you.

678
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,670
And the data that you might
not need, right then and there,

679
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:19,040
stays on the slower,
more mechanical device

680
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,620
where, nonetheless, you
have a lot more storage.

681
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,560
Now flash memory is something you
might have heard about before now,

682
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,620
but in the form of
these things here, USB

683
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,670
sticks that might store 1
gigabyte or 16 gigabytes or more.

684
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,419
But it's data that you might want
to carry around on your keychain

685
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,730
or in your pocket or keep
around on your desk simply

686
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,219
for transferring files from
one computer to another

687
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:39,039
or keeping some data with you.

688
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:41,330
They tend to be slower though,
than solid state drives.

689
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,040
They tend to be less reliable.

690
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,120
But they also tend to be much
less expensive, but also smaller

691
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,030
in capacity.

692
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,851
But the technology is
very similar in spirit.

693
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:51,559
If you need more
storage space than that,

694
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,972
you might actually carry around with
you a solid state drive externally.

695
00:34:54,972 --> 00:34:57,180
So it might be a little
bigger, and a little heavier,

696
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,305
and not something you want
to put on your keychain.

697
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:03,320
But this might store
256 gigabytes of space

698
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,270
or even a terabyte of space, all of
which is now carried around externally.

699
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,880
And via some kind of cable
can you plug this device

700
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,240
into your laptop or desktop or maybe
a friend or colleague's computer

701
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,630
so that you can share files
without having a local network.

702
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,290
If you need even more storage than that,
1 terabyte, 2 terabytes, 4 terabytes,

703
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:24,830
or more, you might actually have
another type of external hard drive

704
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:28,610
inside of which is one of those older
more traditional mechanical drives,

705
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:33,950
the 3 and 1/2 inch disk devices, that
might store much, much, much more data.

706
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:36,750
But the price you pay is that
it's a mechanical device.

707
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,090
It might be, therefore,
a little bit slower.

708
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,240
And so ultimately,
there's this trade-off

709
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,300
between how much space you get,
how much money you're spending,

710
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,657
and how quickly you can get data
from and to that external device.

711
00:35:48,657 --> 00:35:51,740
In fact, there's this whole series of
trade-offs that we've seen thus far.

712
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,900
And you can actually think
of these various types

713
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,900
of memory inside of a computer
like a funnel of sorts

714
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,010
whereby you have a pretty big opening
where you keep a lot of your data

715
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,630
on the biggest of your devices.

716
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,080
But the goal is to get that data
closer and closer and closer

717
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,390
to your computer's brain where
it can do some actual work.

718
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:12,440
Indeed, if you think of the CPU as
being at the bottom of this funnel,

719
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,260
that's to whom you want
to get all of this data.

720
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,710
So throughout this funnel, you might
have your hard disk or your solid state

721
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,890
disk up here which stores a lot of
your files a lot of your programs

722
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:25,820
persistently in a nonvolatile way
so that it's permanent even when

723
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,610
the power or battery no longer works.

724
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:33,440
But that hard disk or solid state
disk ultimately feeds information down

725
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,300
to your computer's RAM.

726
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,180
But the ram is not the last
stop before the computer's CPU.

727
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,850
It turns out that there's
other types of memory

728
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:45,120
that a computer has that you might even
see mentioned on your computer screen.

729
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,630
So if up here you have
your disk, whether it's

730
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,630
a hard disk drive or a
solid state disk drive,

731
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,760
you might have quite a bit of this.

732
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,250
This might be in the order of gigabytes
or terabytes, billions of bytes

733
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,780
or trillions of bytes.

734
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:05,030
That gets fed into, ultimately, your
computer's RAM, which probably exists

735
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:08,300
on the order of these days of
gigabytes, but fewer gigabytes

736
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,510
than your actual disk.

737
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,840
Down here you're going to have your CPU.

738
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,110
And indeed, the goal is to
get your data to the CPU.

739
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,360
And the CPU, of course,
is measured not in bytes

740
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,490
but in gigahertz-- the
number of billions of things

741
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,220
it can do per second with that data.

742
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,730
But there's also tends to be
something in between RAM and CPU.

743
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:30,830
There's often something called
Level 3 cache, which might

744
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,290
exist in the form of megabytes worth.

745
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:36,680
Then it goes into what's
called Level 2 cache, which

746
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,540
is another type of
memory, which also might

747
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:43,310
be in the kilobyte or thousands
of bytes or megabyte range.

748
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:47,270
And then there might be L1
cache, which doesn't quite

749
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,380
fit on this on the screen.

750
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,010
But that's OK.

751
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:52,160
Because it hints at just how small
of a physical device this is,

752
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,337
which might be on the
order of, say, kilobytes.

753
00:37:55,337 --> 00:37:56,420
So these values will vary.

754
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,860
And they'll certainly change over time.

755
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,180
And so what's the pattern, then,
among these various types of memory

756
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,830
leading to the CPU?

757
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,470
Well, the disk, whether a
hard disk or solid state disk,

758
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:09,500
is not only nonvolatile--
sticks around permanently,

759
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,340
and it's where your files and your
programs are stored when the power is

760
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,091
off--

761
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:16,340
that's the biggest of these
various types of memories,

762
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,660
but it's also the slowest.

763
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,220
Even solid state is slower than
some of these other memories

764
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,210
below it on the funnel here.

765
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:26,870
Meanwhile, RAM tends to exist,
still on the order of gigabytes,

766
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,960
but maybe 1 gigabyte, 4
gigabytes, 16, maybe more

767
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,000
if you've splurged on
a really nice computer.

768
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,310
But RAM recall is where
programs and files

769
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:38,450
live when you double-clicked or
opened them in order to use them

770
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,310
on your computer at a given moment.

771
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,890
Meanwhile though-- and this
is values you don't really

772
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,209
control because they tend
to be associated closely

773
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:47,000
with the CPU or the
motherboard that you've

774
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,160
bought as part of your computer-- that
RAM feeds information into Level 3

775
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,520
and/or Level 2 and/or Level 1 cache in
turn so that it's less memory there,

776
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,560
but it's super, super fast.

777
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,660
And that ensures that, even though
there's less of this memory--

778
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:07,190
Level 1 cache exists in smaller
quantities than Level 3--

779
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,930
that funnel is just always filled.

780
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,096
There's always something
at the bottom of the funnel

781
00:39:11,096 --> 00:39:12,440
ready to be fed into the CPU.

782
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,520
So the CPU never, theoretically,
has to wait for any data--

783
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,420
to get numbers to crunch, or
text to display, or the like.

784
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,930
Meanwhile, there exists,
turns out, tiny little pieces

785
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:27,740
of memory in a computer that we'll
give a name to called registers.

786
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:33,440
And these registers typically only hold
1 byte or 4 bytes or 8 bytes total.

787
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,630
So they're the smallest unit of memory.

788
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,320
But it's in those registers
that the CPU stores values

789
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,800
like numbers like those decimal
numbers we discussed earlier.

790
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,344
And if it wants to perform
arithmetic of any sort,

791
00:39:46,344 --> 00:39:49,260
it stores those values in these
registers, actually performs the math,

792
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,890
stores the result in another
register, so it's, then, ready

793
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,910
to be loaded back through this funnel
into something like the computer's RAM

794
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:58,550
or ultimately saved back to disk.

795
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,200
But there's another trade-off here.

796
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,800
Besides the top of this funnel
being bigger and slower,

797
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,736
and the bottom of this funnel
being smaller and faster,

798
00:40:06,736 --> 00:40:09,110
the bottom of the funnel also
tends to be more expensive,

799
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,570
which also explains, in
part, why you see less

800
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,600
of this memory inside of a computer.

801
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,939
The Level 1 cache might be
more expensive than ram,

802
00:40:15,939 --> 00:40:18,230
so you have less of it and,
technically, you don't even

803
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:20,396
need as much of it so long
as there's enough to keep

804
00:40:20,396 --> 00:40:22,400
data waiting for the CPU.

805
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,220
But cost is certainly
another trade-off as well.

806
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,446
But the types of numbers that you, as
a consumer, might care about, really,

807
00:40:28,446 --> 00:40:30,320
would be how big the
disk in your computer is

808
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,929
and how much data and programs
and files you can store,

809
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:34,220
how much RAM your computer has.

810
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,620
Because that correlates
with just how much work

811
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,860
you can do at once, how
many files and programs you

812
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:42,150
can keep running simultaneously
without having to quit any of them.

813
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:45,530
And so cache, finally,
which is more closely

814
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:49,080
tied to the CPU and the motherboard
in your computer and, therefore,

815
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,310
isn't really a number you have as
much control over as the consumer,

816
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:55,430
just ensures that the
data is actually ready.

817
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,460
Now this might all
sound fairly technical.

818
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,920
But these caches, whether
Level 3 or 2 or 1 are actually

819
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,930
quite similar to techniques that
we humans use in the real world,

820
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,900
for instance, even at
your local candy store.

821
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,000
Here's my candy store,
and I'm open for business.

822
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,560


823
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,580
SPEAKER: Candy, please?

824
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,330
DAVID J. MALAN: Let
me get you some candy.

825
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,950
[FOOTSTEPS]

826
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:22,081


827
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:22,580
Thank you.

828
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,516
Come again.

829
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:26,890
Now that was not very efficient
to have to go all the way

830
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:29,030
and back into the store
room to get the candy.

831
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,970
Much more efficient would
be to keep it closer to me

832
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:36,470
in a place that's faster to access
much like a cache of candy right here

833
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,220
on the counter.

834
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,094
In fact, let me go ahead
and ready that cash.

835
00:41:39,094 --> 00:41:41,196
[FOOTSTEPS]

836
00:41:41,196 --> 00:41:45,190


837
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:49,806
And now, with this cache of candy
am I open for business again.

838
00:41:49,806 --> 00:41:51,090
SPEAKER: Candy, please?

839
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,173
DAVID J. MALAN: Thank you.

840
00:41:52,173 --> 00:41:53,250
Come again.

841
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,650
Now this is a small cache
of candy, but it's fast.

842
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:59,550
And, with it, can I provide my customers
or really my CPU with information

843
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,930
much more quickly.

844
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,950


845
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:07,600
Now we can actually see the sizes
of these caches in that same output

846
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,104
that we saw earlier
from Windows and Mac OS.

847
00:42:10,104 --> 00:42:12,520
For instance, if we look again
at the Windows Task Manager

848
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,330
and look down here, you can actually
see that this particular laptop

849
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:20,500
had L1 cache on the order of 128
kilobytes or thousands of bytes.

850
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,870
It had 512 kilobytes of L2 cache,
and 4 megabytes of L3 cache.

851
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,940
Meanwhile, if we take a look at
that same MacBook Pro from earlier,

852
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:34,150
you'll see that it has 256 kilobytes
of cache, 4 megabytes of L3 cache,

853
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:37,960
doesn't happen to mention L1 cache, but
odds are, it's indeed there on the CPU,

854
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,930
just not reported by this program.

855
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:44,830
Now what else is inside or
really outside of a computer?

856
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:48,070
In fact, let's start to take a look
at things, perhaps, more familiar.

857
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:52,630
Now these are just graphical
depictions of connectors or sockets

858
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:56,290
on the back of your computer into
which you might have very well plugged

859
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:57,740
in various devices.

860
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,610
In fact, this collection
of ports here are all

861
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,310
related to monitors or displays.

862
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,800
So a computer, like a
desktop computer, tends

863
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,640
not to come with a monitor built in.

864
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,990
And if it does, indeed not, you might
need to plug-in an external monitor

865
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:13,570
using something like mini DisplayPort--

866
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,750
very commonly found on laptops,
especially if you want to have,

867
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,520
not just your primary
laptop display, but

868
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,130
a secondary, a bigger
monitor on your desk--

869
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:24,040
DisplayPort, which is the same
idea, but a larger connector

870
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,130
that you might typically have on a
desktop plugging into a monitor--

871
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:30,430
HDMI, which you might have, not
only on your laptop or desktop,

872
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:34,090
but possibly even on your TV at home
because this is also the type of cable

873
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:37,660
that you would use to plug a TV
into some kind of set-top device

874
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,530
in your living room.

875
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:39,720
And then, lastly, VGA--

876
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,470
still on the list,
even though it's super,

877
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:45,220
super old and not nearly as featureful
as these other technologies.

878
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:48,310
But you'll very often find at
universities like this and companies

879
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:55,030
that have long had projectors installed
in their rooms, this older technology,

880
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:58,130
and so it, too, is still pretty common.

881
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:01,430
Now, what else might we want
to plug into a computer?

882
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:05,680
Well, any number of devices as well-- in
fact, if you've ever seen this symbol,

883
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,540
that means you have a port on your
computer, desktop or laptop, into which

884
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,790
you can plug a whole range of devices.

885
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:14,800
If you've ever needed to plug
a printer into your computer,

886
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,150
you might use the port label with
this-- a scanner, a digital camera,

887
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:23,080
any number of other peripheral devices
might be connected to your computer

888
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,490
by way of this device here.

889
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:27,480
Even your mouse and your keyboard,
if they're not already wireless,

890
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,560
would be plugged in
with this device here.

891
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,889
And it might actually
take any number of shapes,

892
00:44:31,889 --> 00:44:34,430
though thankfully, some of these
are more common than others.

893
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:36,360
This is the universal serial bus--

894
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,740
where a bus as a term
technologically that

895
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:42,670
refers to some kind of medium along
which data can travel, much like a bus

896
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,080
travels down a street.

897
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:48,430
So USB has a whole bunch of different
connectors as depicted here.

898
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:51,190
And the most common of which is
just this rectangular one that,

899
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,820
rather annoyingly, only 50% of the
time do you, if you're like me,

900
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:59,170
plug the cable in the right way because
it can only go in one certain way.

901
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,670
So you might have to flip it around.

902
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,045
But on the other end of that
cable might be another type,

903
00:45:03,045 --> 00:45:07,660
not USB A, but USB B,
which is commonly used

904
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,780
to plug into the back of
scanners and printers and beyond.

905
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:14,290
More recently, though, have
companies like Apples and others

906
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:16,360
started using using USB C--

907
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:20,620
a third type of connector that,
thankfully, can go either top down

908
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,980
or bottom up, thereby, not
having to think as much when

909
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,340
you want to plug in a device.

910
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,423
But there's any number of other variants
of these connectors commonly seen

911
00:45:28,423 --> 00:45:32,530
on cell phones, in fact, for chargers
and data cables, all of which support

912
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:33,430
USB.

913
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,010
Now the USB standard, itself,
has evolved over time.

914
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:39,670
So the latest and greatest version
of USB devices and connectors

915
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:43,630
are actually much faster than some
of the historically older devices

916
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:44,230
and cables.

917
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:47,140
And so it actually does matter
what kind of cable you have

918
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,620
and what device you have as to
whether or not it will transfer data

919
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,090
as fast as you might like.

920
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,390
Now why is this important?

921
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:58,300
Well, one of the devices you can connect
to a computer, typically via USB cable,

922
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,130
is something like an
external hard drive.

923
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,520
And even if you have a super
fast external hard drive that

924
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,580
is, say, an SSD underneath
the hood, if you're

925
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:09,212
using a slower older
USB cable or technology,

926
00:46:09,212 --> 00:46:11,170
you might not, nonetheless,
be able to transfer

927
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:15,490
that data off a very fast device
over a slow cable to your computer.

928
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:19,720
So keeping an eye out for the latest
versions of these technologies like USB

929
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,880
can actually be quite important.

930
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,300
But, of course, you might not need
cables at all for certain devices.

931
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,810
Of course, if you want to use Wi-Fi
or wireless internet in your home,

932
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:32,770
in the airport, in Starbucks,
or elsewhere, your computer just

933
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:36,082
needs to support Wi-Fi, which odds
are, it very much does these days.

934
00:46:36,082 --> 00:46:38,290
And you might see a symbol
somewhere in your computer

935
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:40,450
like this depicting as much.

936
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:43,030
But not everything operates over Wi-Fi.

937
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:46,960
In fact, devices that you might want to
plug into or connect to your computer

938
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,600
without a cable would
tend to use not Wi-Fi,

939
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,000
but another wireless
technology called Bluetooth

940
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,819
that Windows computers and
Macs alike support these days.

941
00:46:55,819 --> 00:46:57,610
So in fact, if you have
a wireless keyboard

942
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:00,610
at home or at work, or a
wireless mouse, or if you

943
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:04,600
have any number of other devices that,
somehow, are wirelessly communicating

944
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,076
with your computer, perhaps even
your headphones these days, odds are,

945
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:10,450
those are using a technology
called Bluetooth, which have

946
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:12,860
a limited range of just so many feeds.

947
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,850


948
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:19,030
They don't afford you nearly as much
distance as something like Wi-Fi does,

949
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,160
but that's a good thing.

950
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,910
Because generally,
this technology is used

951
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:25,420
to interconnect your personal
devices to your personal computer

952
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:28,510
and not really to others around you.

953
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:31,660
So with all of these various
devices inside of and, potentially,

954
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,741
connected outside of
my computer, what is

955
00:47:33,741 --> 00:47:35,865
it that ensures that they
can all intercommunicate?

956
00:47:35,865 --> 00:47:38,280
And what is it that ensures
that all of this works?

957
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,280
Well, at the end of the
day it's the, so-called,

958
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,000
operating system whether
it's Mac OS or Windows,

959
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,090
which is simply software, that
either you or, more likely,

960
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:49,630
some manufacturer pre-installed
on the computer that you bought.

961
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:53,020
And that software is installed on your
hard drive or your solid state disk

962
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,576
so that it's there persistently.

963
00:47:54,576 --> 00:47:56,950
And so that, even when you
unwrap that shrink-wrapped box

964
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,130
that has had no power for some time,
the operating system is ready to go.

965
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,004
And, indeed, when you hit the power
button on your laptop or desktop,

966
00:48:03,004 --> 00:48:07,870
it's the operating system, ultimately,
that is loaded into RAM from disk,

967
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:09,649
and is what you ultimately see.

968
00:48:09,649 --> 00:48:12,190
In fact, it's the operating
system that gives you, literally,

969
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,710
the graphical windows that you
see and the icons and the buttons

970
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:15,550
that you can click.

971
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,920
But more importantly,
it's the operating system

972
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,562
that knows how to talk to
your keyboard and your mouse.

973
00:48:20,562 --> 00:48:22,270
It's your operating
system that knows how

974
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:23,922
to display information on the screen.

975
00:48:23,922 --> 00:48:25,630
It's your operating
system that knows how

976
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:29,080
to move things around in memory
and disk and reading and writing

977
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,577
all of that information.

978
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:33,160
And that's all thanks to software
that comes with an operating

979
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,200
system called device drivers--

980
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,280
special software designed to talk
to a certain model of printer,

981
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,149
to a certain model of camera,
or scanner, and the like.

982
00:48:42,149 --> 00:48:45,190
And, in fact, even when Windows or
Mac OS or Linux or any other operating

983
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:49,000
system doesn't recognize some device--
maybe because it didn't exist when

984
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,759
Windows or Mac OS or Linux was
installed on your computer--

985
00:48:52,759 --> 00:48:55,300
well, you can very often download
new software device drivers

986
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,210
from the manufacturer's website
of the manufacturer that

987
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,660
made that new technology.

988
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:03,310
And that can teach Windows and
Mac OS and Linux and others

989
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,980
to understand that new hardware.

990
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,500
And so there is a future-proofing
built into these operating systems

991
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,930
because, at the end of the
day, they're just software.

992
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:13,180
And so it's this intersection
of hardware and software

993
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:16,360
that makes these computers
just so powerful.

994
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,570
Now, it's all fun and good
to talk about hardware

995
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:21,430
and see it depicted on the screen.

996
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:24,580
But let's actually get our hands
dirty here and actually enter

997
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,640
into our own laboratory and
take a look on the outside

998
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,210
and inside of some actual computers.

999
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:35,054
I'm here now with Dr. Colton Ogden for
a look inside a couple of computers.

1000
00:49:35,054 --> 00:49:36,970
COLTON OGDEN: Happy to
be with you guys today.

1001
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:39,757
We have an IBM ThinkPad laptop here.

1002
00:49:39,757 --> 00:49:41,340
Nobody really needs to use it anymore.

1003
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:44,381
So I figured we'd show you guys what
a computer looks like on the outside

1004
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,610
before we start digging
in on the inside.

1005
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,810
So you want to start off by maybe
showing what some of these ports

1006
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:50,800
are here on the laptop?

1007
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,020
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah.

1008
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:51,520
Sure.

1009
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,020
So here's one of those older ports.

1010
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,561
And, indeed, this is an older laptop.

1011
00:49:54,561 --> 00:49:58,300
This is a so-called VGA port into which
you would plug a cable to connect it,

1012
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,090
either to an external monitor, or
more realistically, on a campus

1013
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:02,120
or in a workplace.

1014
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,660
It's like a projector so
that other people can see.

1015
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:08,870
If you can believe it, this is an RJ11
jack for an old school modem or a phone

1016
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:09,370
cable.

1017
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:12,130
So that you could
actually dial up to AOL.

1018
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,360
COLTON OGDEN: Old school.

1019
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,460
DAVID J.MALAN: Here's
an RJ45 connector, which

1020
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:19,150
actually looks like this here,
as sort of a fat network cable.

1021
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:22,780
And that's what you would use to
get online with wired internet.

1022
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:26,320
Here, we have a microphone jack, if you
have an external mic, headphone jack

1023
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,640
if you want to listen to
music at work, USB to connect

1024
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,710
any number of external devices.

1025
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:33,220
And oh.

1026
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,740
What's this one we've got over here?

1027
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,090
COLTON OGDEN: It looks
like we've got a DVD port.

1028
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:38,340
You don't see these very often anymore.

1029
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,381
It's not going to work
because the laptop is off.

1030
00:50:40,381 --> 00:50:42,770
But we also have a couple of
USB ports here on the side.

1031
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:45,160
And I think that's pretty
much all we have on this guy.

1032
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:45,270
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah.

1033
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:48,130
A DVD or CD drive is what's
known as optical storage.

1034
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:51,400
And it really is just a piece
of plastic, the CD or DVD,

1035
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,550
with some reflective material on
it and little divots or pits that

1036
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:57,460
are created with a laser that
gets, then, read with the laser

1037
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,920
so that you can actually
write 0s and 1s by,

1038
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,470
essentially, having a smooth
surface or little bumps.

1039
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:06,620
But it's increasingly falling into
disuse as Flash Media of various sorts

1040
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,960
is being used instead.

1041
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,030
Well, why don't we not
gut this, although, I do

1042
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:12,340
see it's power cable sitting here.

1043
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:16,030
So you'll notice that most laptops
like this have power cables that one

1044
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:19,030
go into the wall, then some other
proprietary or standard connector that

1045
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:20,590
goes into the laptop, and then a brick.

1046
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:22,173
Sometimes that gets a little bit warm.

1047
00:51:22,173 --> 00:51:24,430
And what this brick is
doing is it's actually

1048
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:28,450
converting the 120 volts or 240
volts coming out of your wall

1049
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:32,620
to far fewer volts that your
laptop can actually tolerate.

1050
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,720
Shall we take a look
at the desktop next?

1051
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,080
COLTON OGDEN: Yeah.

1052
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:35,440
Perfect.

1053
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,689
So let's go ahead and take a look at the
internals of a computer with this guy

1054
00:51:38,689 --> 00:51:39,550
here.

1055
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:44,240
So I'm going to go ahead and just
take off the casing's lid here.

1056
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,040
DAVID J. MALAN: And
this is an older PC--

1057
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:46,320
COLTON OGDEN: Yes.

1058
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:46,870
DAVID J. MALAN: --desktop right?

1059
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,400
An older Windows PC.

1060
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,517
And so you find that Mac computers
aren't so readily taken apart.

1061
00:51:51,517 --> 00:51:53,350
In fact, that's one of
the features of Apple

1062
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:55,945
computers is that they have far
fewer user serviceable parts,

1063
00:51:55,945 --> 00:51:57,820
but the price you pay,
of course, is that you

1064
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,605
can't upgrade them or reconfigure
them, often using magnets to.

1065
00:52:00,605 --> 00:52:01,480
COLTON OGDEN: Indeed.

1066
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:01,890
DAVID J. MALAN: All right.

1067
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:03,300
So what do we have inside of here?

1068
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:03,530
COLTON OGDEN: OK.

1069
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,570
So we have, in here, a lot
of the parts you were just

1070
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:06,820
talking about in your lecture.

1071
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,724
We have a CPU with its heat
sink here, right in the middle.

1072
00:52:09,724 --> 00:52:11,390
DAVID J. MALAN: That's a huge heat sink.

1073
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:12,225
And that does what?

1074
00:52:12,225 --> 00:52:13,600
COLTON OGDEN: It dissipates heat.

1075
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,870
A CPU is very hot.

1076
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:16,370
It's oscillating very fast.

1077
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:20,780
And so the purpose of this is to,
with all of these planes, disperse

1078
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:25,070
the heat equally and then get
rid of it alongside the fan

1079
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:26,850
as well, which acts in tandem with it.

1080
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:27,020
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah.

1081
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,120
It's a big fan, like you
would have in the summertime.

1082
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:29,600
COLTON OGDEN: Oh, yeah.

1083
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,101
Definitely.

1084
00:52:30,101 --> 00:52:31,183
DAVID J. MALAN: All right.

1085
00:52:31,183 --> 00:52:32,660
And what about these green sticks?

1086
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,550
COLTON OGDEN: These green sticks,
we only have one in this laptop.

1087
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:37,460
But this is actually a stick
of RAM, so random access memory

1088
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,909
where computers' programs
are stored as they're loaded.

1089
00:52:39,909 --> 00:52:40,700
DAVID J. MALAN: OK.

1090
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,476
And that's connected to this
bigger green sheet, which is--

1091
00:52:43,476 --> 00:52:45,850
COLTON OGDEN: This bigger
green sheet is the motherboard.

1092
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:47,930
It's sort of like the
central hub for all the parts

1093
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,388
working together with the computer.

1094
00:52:49,388 --> 00:52:51,860
It acts as sort of a messaging
interface for everything.

1095
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,120
DAVID J. MALAN: OK.

1096
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,590
And now, doctor, can I take
a look at that piece of RAM?

1097
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:55,230
Do you need it?

1098
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:55,790
COLTON OGDEN: Absolutely.

1099
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:55,920
No.

1100
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,930
Let's take it out of here.

1101
00:52:56,930 --> 00:52:57,110
DAVID J. MALAN: All right.

1102
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:58,745
So that just snaps right out.

1103
00:52:58,745 --> 00:52:59,350
COLTON OGDEN: Snaps right out.

1104
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:00,141
DAVID J. MALAN: Ah.

1105
00:53:00,141 --> 00:53:03,242
So it looks pretty much like
the image we had earlier

1106
00:53:03,242 --> 00:53:05,200
with a bunch of black
chips here, each of which

1107
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,950
store some number of megabytes
or gigabytes probably.

1108
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:10,700
And then the little gold pin, so
to speak, that could actually get

1109
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:11,120
plugged in.

1110
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,420
And they can only go a certain way.

1111
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,020
In fact, I've done this blindly
before where I've accidentally

1112
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:18,020
plugged it in the wrong way, only to
realize, it actually goes this way.

1113
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,595
And that's why this little
divot here is asymmetric.

1114
00:53:20,595 --> 00:53:21,470
COLTON OGDEN: Indeed.

1115
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:23,640
DAVID J. MALAN: I'm
done with this, doctor.

1116
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,140
OK.

1117
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,070
We're not going to put that back in.

1118
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:27,200
And what's this big thing
in the back of a PC?

1119
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,377
COLTON OGDEN: So this is
the Power Supply or PSU.

1120
00:53:29,377 --> 00:53:32,460
It essentially just powers everything
up with electricity in the computer.

1121
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:32,800
DAVID J. MALAN: I see.

1122
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,330
And so if this is the extent
to which you've actually

1123
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:38,038
played with the inside of your
computer before-- this, of course,

1124
00:53:38,038 --> 00:53:39,081
is the power cable.

1125
00:53:39,081 --> 00:53:42,080
And this is actually a standardized
plug that goes back into the device.

1126
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,860
You can actually use this or any number
of other cables on your own computer.

1127
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,310
COLTON OGDEN: Indeed.

1128
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:45,470
DAVID J. MALAN: All right.

1129
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:48,590
So where is my data stored
when not in RAM persistently?

1130
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:52,170
COLTON OGDEN: When not in RAM, you have,
here, an external Hard Drive, an HDB,

1131
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,920
or an internal hard
drive in this context.

1132
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,711
DAVID J. MALAN: OK.

1133
00:53:54,711 --> 00:53:58,341
So this is older and bigger
probably than something like an SSD?

1134
00:53:58,341 --> 00:53:59,090
COLTON OGDEN: Yes.

1135
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:04,579
Older and larger, but probably stores
less since this is an older computer.

1136
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:07,620
And it's connected to the motherboard
using what's called the SATA cable,

1137
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,560
S-A-T-A, which hooks right
into the motherboard.

1138
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:09,890
DAVID J. MALAN: Oh, yeah.

1139
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:12,210
Can we can we pull that out
without that much damage here?

1140
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:12,600
COLTON OGDEN: Yeah.

1141
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,099
Absolutely.

1142
00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:16,129
So it's a pretty small cable, it plugs
right into the motherboard there.

1143
00:54:16,129 --> 00:54:16,920
DAVID J. MALAN: Ah.

1144
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,555
OK.

1145
00:54:17,555 --> 00:54:21,980
So it's got kind of a nice angled shape
so that it only goes, in it would seem,

1146
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:22,690
one way.

1147
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:23,190
All right.

1148
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:25,100
And actually, it looks like
a different type of cable

1149
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,360
is used for this older technology.

1150
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,230
We seem to have another
DVD or CD drive up there?

1151
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:28,700
COLTON OGDEN: We do.

1152
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,200
We do.

1153
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,220
We have a DVD drive.

1154
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,050
And actually it does you SATA as well.

1155
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:33,462
DAVID J. MALAN: Oh, Yes.

1156
00:54:33,462 --> 00:54:34,980
COLTON OGDEN: It plugs right
in with the hard drives.

1157
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:35,260
DAVID J. MALAN: Oh.

1158
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,450
But it has a special power
cable that drives that.

1159
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:38,200
COLTON OGDEN: Yep.

1160
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:38,330
Exactly.

1161
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:40,496
DAVID J. MALAN: --just like
the hard drive does too.

1162
00:54:40,496 --> 00:54:43,050
So actually, we have,
in advance, taken apart

1163
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:46,875
and 3.5 inch mechanical hard
drive that you previously

1164
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:49,250
had a whole bunch of screws
on it and probably previously

1165
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:50,902
had a whole bunch of data on it.

1166
00:54:50,902 --> 00:54:52,610
But now that we've
exposed it to the air,

1167
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:55,100
and therefore all of the dust
particles here in the theater,

1168
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,058
probably not going to be
very reliable anymore.

1169
00:54:57,058 --> 00:55:00,680
But what's really cool now is that
we took off all but one of the screws

1170
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,890
so we can actually pull this off.

1171
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:09,570
And you can see what's been inside your
own hard drive perhaps all this time.

1172
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:12,080
So this is, again, is 3
and 1/2 inches across,

1173
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:15,680
which is a standard size, at least, for
these older larger mechanical drives.

1174
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,530
There's also a 2.5 inch version
of this commonly found in laptops

1175
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:21,020
or even higher-end desktops these days.

1176
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:23,870
And there's that mechanical arm
that won't move now because there's

1177
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:25,220
no power going into this.

1178
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,370
But if there were, we'd be plugging
it in to the back of the device

1179
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:32,030
here and then that SATA cable,
which actually runs the power.

1180
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:35,840
And how many-- it looks like
there's two platters here.

1181
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,410
Two platters.

1182
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:38,810
So the data store probably
on the top, on the bottom,

1183
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:40,876
and then on the other
top, and the other bottom,

1184
00:55:40,876 --> 00:55:42,500
thereby fitting even more data in here.

1185
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,360
And if this were an even
newer bigger hard drive,

1186
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,060
we could probably fit even more
platters, and therefore more data.

1187
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,790
And increasingly, is the data being
stored closer and closer together,

1188
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:52,490
so all those magnetic particles
are packed ever more densely,

1189
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:54,590
which also means we can
store more bits and thus

1190
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:56,881
bytes and thus files and programs.

1191
00:55:56,881 --> 00:55:57,380
All right.

1192
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:00,090
So what we also have here a motherboard.

1193
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,700
Can we take a closer look
at this outside of the box?

1194
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:03,825
COLTON OGDEN: Yes.

1195
00:56:03,825 --> 00:56:06,200
DAVID J. MALAN: So this one
looks a little bit different.

1196
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,540
And, in fact, I don't see a CPU.

1197
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:09,589
Where's our CPU gone?

1198
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:11,630
COLTON OGDEN: Well, this
one does not have a CPU.

1199
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:12,921
It's been taken out in advance.

1200
00:56:12,921 --> 00:56:15,440
But most of the other components
are still in place here.

1201
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,811
We have RAM, we have a heat sink,
and we have a lot of other ports

1202
00:56:18,811 --> 00:56:21,560
and such that we've seen on the
other motherboard and was looking.

1203
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,870
DAVID J. MALAN: And these internal
ports, what gets plugged into those?

1204
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:25,550
COLTON OGDEN: So these are PCI slots.

1205
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:28,580
You'll see oftentimes
graphics cards, sound cards--

1206
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:31,880
other things that aren't
necessarily always with a computer,

1207
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,339
but are optional-- those get
plugged into these ports here.

1208
00:56:34,339 --> 00:56:37,546
DAVID J. MALAN: And it looks like if we
plug this into the back of a computer

1209
00:56:37,546 --> 00:56:40,520
just right, these things should stick
out the back of the plastic case?

1210
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:40,850
COLTON OGDEN: Yes.

1211
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:43,040
These are ports that
are often user-facing,

1212
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:48,230
so you can plug-in peripherals
such as keyboards, mice,

1213
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:53,150
monitors with VGA ports, maybe
headphones or speakers with these ports

1214
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:57,419
here, headphones, microphones line
out, and a few other ports, maybe--

1215
00:56:57,419 --> 00:57:00,460
DAVID J. MALAN: Do you want to talk
to them in some of these older ports?

1216
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,680
These are really from my day.

1217
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,513
So the parallel port,
which is where we used

1218
00:57:03,513 --> 00:57:06,020
to put our printers or serial ports--

1219
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,520
I don't know what voice that
is-- but our serial ports where

1220
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:12,630
we used to put our joysticks for playing
the games, a VGA port, of course,

1221
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:16,110
and then a whole bunch of USB
ports there, which we can actually

1222
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:17,370
take a closer look at a cable.

1223
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:20,160
So here's a common end of a USB cable.

1224
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,340
This is Type A, and so that's
probably the most common type.

1225
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,457
But the white plastic on the inside
suggests that this is an older cable.

1226
00:57:26,457 --> 00:57:28,290
If you look at newer
cables, you'll actually

1227
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:31,260
see that the inside is blue, which
means its USB 3.0, which generally

1228
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:34,230
means faster, which means you can
move data back and forth all the more

1229
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:34,890
quickly.

1230
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:37,140
But on the other ends
of these USB cables--

1231
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,030
you see, like the Type
B connector here--

1232
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:42,860
this is commonly found in the
back of a printer or a scanner.

1233
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,565
So it's a slightly different plug.

1234
00:57:44,565 --> 00:57:46,840
It keeps one end
straight from the other.

1235
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,440
But you will actually see
sometimes smaller cables

1236
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,110
like this one here, mini
or micro USB, commonly

1237
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:54,450
found on phones or just
smaller devices where

1238
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:57,146
it would be annoying to try to
plug-in something as big as this.

1239
00:57:57,146 --> 00:57:59,520
Well, I think we have just a
couple of other things here.

1240
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,362
Here we have-- this
came from a computer.

1241
00:58:01,362 --> 00:58:03,570
No CPU attached, but this
is one of those heat sinks?

1242
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:04,130
You were talking about?

1243
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:04,963
COLTON OGDEN: It is.

1244
00:58:04,963 --> 00:58:07,320
It's a combo of a heat
sink and a fan for a CPU.

1245
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,236
DAVID J. MALAN: I see.

1246
00:58:08,236 --> 00:58:11,140
So Intel Inside might also mean you
have an Intel fan, it would seem,

1247
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:11,790
and heat sink.

1248
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:15,210
And then lastly, we've got
one of these things here.

1249
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:16,140
What's this here?

1250
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:18,098
COLTON OGDEN: This is a
solid state hard drive,

1251
00:58:18,098 --> 00:58:23,070
which actually uses flash memory very
akin to microSDs, if you're familiar.

1252
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:24,990
It's essentially what a hard drive is.

1253
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:27,990
But instead of having a
movable mechanical arm that

1254
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:31,400
looks at the different bits on
the platters, as we talked about,

1255
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,370
it's almost like RAM.

1256
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:35,490
It's just storing the
data in electricity,

1257
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:37,097
hence solid state, no moving parts.

1258
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:38,430
DAVID J. MALAN: But permanently.

1259
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:39,346
COLTON OGDEN: But yes.

1260
00:58:39,346 --> 00:58:41,310
It's nonvolatile, which
means, unlike RAM, you

1261
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:44,340
can actually store this whether or not
you turn your laptop off or whatever.

1262
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:44,850
DAVID J. MALAN: All right.

1263
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:46,558
And it looks like--
and I'm told I've got

1264
00:58:46,558 --> 00:58:49,420
to be extra careful with this--
this is a 4 terabyte SSD.

1265
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:52,300
So this is a huge amount
of data, 4 trillion bytes.

1266
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,050
So we're just going to
put this safely over here.

1267
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:57,470
Less expensively, though, we
have this little USB stick.

1268
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:59,757
It's still 128 gigabytes,
but it's a little gimmicky.

1269
00:58:59,757 --> 00:59:01,590
But this thing slides
out here, and then you

1270
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:04,170
can plug it into your laptop or
desktop or really any device.

1271
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:06,045
And it's a really
convenient way, ultimately,

1272
00:59:06,045 --> 00:59:08,800
just like moving files back
and forth between each other.

1273
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,300
All right.

1274
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,710
Well, Dr. Ogden, thank you so much.

1275
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:13,918
I'm sure you're going to want to take
care of putting this all back together.

1276
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:16,130
And this was hardware.

1277
00:59:16,130 --> 00:00:00,000
